## Getting Started with Regex

This section covers the basics of using regex in Python, including functions like `re.search()`, `re.findall()`, and `re.finditer()`. It explains how to search for patterns, handle multiple occurrences, and retrieve matched strings and indices.

## Pattern Matching with Alphanumeric

Here, you'll learn how to perform pattern matching with alphanumeric characters. Topics include finding patterns with specific endings or beginnings, matching patterns with specific scenarios, and extracting alphanumeric sequences.

## Text Preprocessing with Regex

In this section, you'll explore text preprocessing techniques using regex. Topics covered include removing special characters, excluding specific patterns, and finding and replacing text patterns.

## Email Pattern Matching with Regex

Learn how to extract email addresses from text using regex. This section covers identifying email patterns, extracting user IDs, host names, and domain types from email addresses.

## DIY Pattern Matching - Continuous Numbers

Discover how to perform DIY pattern matching to identify continuous numbers in text without using regex. Topics include identifying continuous number sequences and extracting them from text.

## DIY Pattern Matching - Words Finding

Explore DIY pattern matching techniques to find words in text. This section covers finding words based on specific criteria, such as starting or ending characters.

## DIY Pattern Matching - Words Starting from Specific Characters

Learn how to find words starting from specific characters in text. Topics include identifying words starting with specific characters and extracting them from text.

## DIY Pattern Matching - Email Extraction

Finally, learn how to extract email addresses from text using DIY pattern matching techniques. This section covers extracting user IDs, host names, and domain types from email addresses without using regex.
